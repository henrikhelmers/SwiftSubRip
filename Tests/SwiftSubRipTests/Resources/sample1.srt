1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
In the twilight's gentle glow,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Where dreams and hopes doth flow,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I'll weave a tapestry of words,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
A poem to touch your soul's chords.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
In fields of golden sunlight gleaming,

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Where love and beauty lie, dreaming,

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'll pluck the stars from the night's embrace,

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
And sprinkle them upon your grace.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
With verses crafted like petals of a rose,

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'll paint a portrait only your heart knows,

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Each line a whisper, soft and true,

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
A melody that sings of me and you.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Let me sketch the moon's silver smile,

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
And capture it within each verse's mile,

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Let my words dance on the river's flow,

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
And carry your spirit where dreams may go.

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Through meadows blooming with fragrant delight,

18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'll trace your dreams in the soft moonlight,

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
And in the tapestry of my poetic art,

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'll etch the love that binds our hearts.

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
For in these lines, a love story unfolds,

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
A tale of passion that forever holds,

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
In every stanza, a love letter to you,

24
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
A masterpiece painted in words so true.

25
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
So let this poem be a sweet caress,

26
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
A sanctuary where your heart finds rest,

27
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
And may it remind you, forevermore,

28
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
That in my words, your love I adore.
