1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
In the REALM of BOUNDLESS skies,
Where DREAMS soar and COURAGE lies,
I'll pen a POEM of GRAND design,
With LONGER lines and ACTIONS fine!

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Through VALLEYS DEEP and MOUNTAINS HIGH,
Where ECHOES DANCE and PASSIONS sigh,
I'll PAINT a PICTURE with VIBRANT strokes,
Of HEROES BRAVE and MIGHTY folks!

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
With THUNDEROUS steps and SWORDS ablaze,
They MARCH through WARS and ENDLESS days,
Their HEARTS aflame with VALOR'S fire,
For HONOR'S SAKE, they NEVER tire!

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
In BATTLES fierce and EPIC clashes,
They RISE above in DARING flashes,
Each BLOW a SYMPHONY of might,
As FOES fall back in STUNNING sight!

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
On STEEDS of THUNDER, they CHARGE ahead,
Across the FIELDS with COURAGE spread,
Their DESTINIES entwined with FATE,
For VICTORY they PATIENTLY wait!

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Through LABYRINTHINE forests DEEP,
Where SECRETS hide and SHADOWS creep,
They NAVIGATE with UNWAVERING will,
Through TREACHEROUS paths, they FULFILL!

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
With MAGIC'S touch and SPELLS unbound,
They CONJURE WONDERS, profound,
From ANCIENT tomes and MYSTIC lore,
They HARNESS POWERS, forevermore!

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
In the REALM of IMAGINATION'S flight,
I'll CRAFT a POEM, BOLD and BRIGHT,
With LONGER LINES that SWEEP and FLOW,
In a WHIRLWIND of ACTION'S SHOW!

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
So let these VERSES IGNITE your SOUL,
In TALES of HEROES who REACH their GOAL,
With EVERY word, let your SPIRIT RISE,
As you JOURNEY through these WONDROUS skies!

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
For in this REALM of POETIC might,
Where DREAMS take FLIGHT and DARKNESS fights,
Embrace the POWER of these POETIC rhymes,
And let your SPIRIT dance in ENDLESS times! Woohoo!
